# email_admin_app
**Goal: Create email account for new hires at a company.**
<br>
The application generates an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
<br>
<br>
In order to satisfy the email syntax, the new hire will be prompted to enter in the department they are located in within the company. For the sake of complexity, the code only offers 4 different options for a new hire to choose from but can be extended to offer more if needed. 
<br>
With a new email comes a password the new hire will receive. The hire's password is displayed, but can be changed by the hire. Along with changing their password, a new hire is able to change their mailbox capacity and provide an alternate email. 
<br>
<br>
The code creates one email for testing purposes. The new email object will envoke a method to display the new hire's first name, last name, (company/alt) email, and mailbox capacity.
